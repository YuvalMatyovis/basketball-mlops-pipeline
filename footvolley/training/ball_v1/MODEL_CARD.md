# ball_v1 (single-class ball detector)

- Base: yolo11n (Ultralytics), fine-tuned in Colab (T4): 50 epochs, imgsz=1280, hsv_h=0.05, ~15 min. Best checkpoint = epoch 43.
- Data: FOTEVOLLY dataset (Ultralytics Platform, public; 417 images, 1 class). License/terms not verified - credit the author before publishing.
  Re-export the .ndjson from the platform to reproduce (signed URLs expire). Prepared with footvolley/src/prepare_dataset.py
  (block split: 298 train / 119 val).
- Val results (dataset's own val, 114 instances): P 0.906, R 0.807, mAP50 0.831, mAP50-95 0.321
- Caveats: small noisy val set (mAP50 last 10 epochs: mean 0.81, std 0.016); best.pt chosen on the same val;
  domain differs from our clip (broadcast beach volleyball vs phone footvolley).
- NOT yet evaluated on foochi_test (the real test; never used for training).
- Weights: models/ball_v1.pt (not in git). Training notebook: run in Colab with args.yaml settings.

## Evaluation on our clip (foochi_test) - FAILED
Visual check: at conf 0.15 the model flagged something in every frame (178/178), always >1 object,
none of them the ball. At imgsz 640/960, conf 0.4: 1.20 / 0.71 detections per frame, still wrong.
Example: ball clearly visible against the sky was missed, a player's foot was boxed instead.
Likely cause (hypothesis): domain mismatch - training data is broadcast footage from a high angle
with sand backgrounds, so sky backgrounds and larger balls were never seen; only 298 training images.
Lesson: compare a few dataset images with our own frames BEFORE training; a detection rate without
precision is meaningless.
